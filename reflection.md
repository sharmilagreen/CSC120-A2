What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

This assignment was a little confusing for me as someone who did not take 110. I was confused about the point of using object oriented programming in Python. I also was out of practice with my Python which made it more challenging. After going to TA hours, though, I was able to complete the assignment and felt like I understood what was going on.
